**Summary**


- Currently I am in the proposal phase of this Milestone. 


- This web application must host a product

- We will use two javaScript Frameworks React and Angular both on an Express.js server.

- our product should include properties with at least three different data types in the MySQL database. The web application should implement the abilities to list, create, read, update, and delete a "product.

- Design and develop back-end services using Express and NodeJS that will be used by two front-end web applications. The implementation of the REST API should simply be a fa√ßade over any business logic required to process the back-end data and relational database using MySQL.

- Design and develop a front-end web application using the Angular JavaScript Framework. The web application should be integrated with the REST APIs developed using Express.

- You will redevelop the same front-end web application, this time using the React JavaScript Framework. 

- Christian Theme. As an option, consider using a biblical or Christian worldview theme for the project. Consider building an app that serves an organization you support. Consider looking for "products" such as bible verses, prayers, contacts, events, images, devotions, commentary, songs, etc. that you could track via this application. Finally, for inspirational ideas, look at some lists of existing mobile apps designed for Christian communities, located in the topic Resources. 

- Document all technical decisions and technical designs via the design report. This report will capture all appropriate UML diagrams, ER diagrams, UI designs, and other technical artifacts to support the design of the end-to-end solution and application.

# Description

- I want to develope a web application that will act as a store front for my buisness. The buisness will sell modified gamecubes with various modification such as raspberry pi installation, cubeboot software modification etc. The business will also offer services for individuals to select modifications and send their personal gamecubes to me so I can then install them for a fraction of the cost. 
---
# List of requirements:

  
- as a user I want to add items to a shopping cart so that I can buy items from the store.

- as a user I want to be able to select services so that I can modify my personal gamecube. 
  

- as a user I want to be able to select a color and have that color of gamecube become visable on the screen, so that I can purchase one based off my favorite color. 


- as a user I want to be able to email to business so that I can ensure they have gotten my device for repair/ modification services.
